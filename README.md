# branding-bot
A Discord utility bot for working with server branding

## Installation

This project requires you to have [`cairo`](https://www.cairographics.org) installed.

<details>
<summary>Note: installing cairo on macOS</summary>

If you're on an Apple Silicon (eg. M1) Mac and installing cairo with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (`brew install cairo`), make sure that the python version you use to create the `poetry` virtual environment was installed using Homebrew. Otherwise, the bot won't be able to find cairo on your system. Refer to [this issue](https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG/issues/354) for further information.
